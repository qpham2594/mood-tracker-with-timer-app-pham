# mood-tracker-with-timer-app

Background:

For this project, I wanted to create something that I feel would be useful for those with ADHD, like myself. Being an adult with a late diagnosis, it can be challenging to grasp that almost everything I have done, experience, and feel in my life stem from ADHD.
Some of the things I struggle with my whole life is understanding my own feelings and why I feel a certain way. I used to think that I was emotional and others would think I am dramatic. But, recently, I have learned that people like myself experience emotions 
a lot stronger than others in society. If a neurotypical individual scale of emotions is from 1-10, mine is probably 5-15 -- there is no 1. With those feelings, they are ultimately like a explosions due to different chain reactions that I were not aware of myself. 


Here's how a typical cycle of emotions work from a day to day basis. I can only prioritize tasks if they are urgent or absolutely important, anything besides that are all on the same level for me - and most things in life are never THAT important, so I basically can 
never prioritize things on my list. Everything seems important, everything needs to be done by the same day. So then, I just get stress, get hyperfocus, and do everything, be everywhere, all at once. People use the word "hyerfocus" too loosely these days. I am talking
so focused that I will sit in front of my computer cranking out work for 10-12 hours straight, no break, no water, no food, no standing up. Then the chances of me getting all those things done by the end of the day are pretty slim, so I go to bed laying there stressing and thinking about what I would have to do, sleep for a few hours, wake up and repeat. After a few days, sometimes a week straight of this, I end up so overwhelmed that I become physically unwell. Yet, throughout that week, I do not notice any changes mentally. So, then everything becomes a trigger and I end up crying, getting angry, feeling annoyed and frustrated at everything little things. As a result, I feel bad for treating people a certain way, go lay in bed, and takes about 1 week to recharge myself.

Recently, I have been doing a physical mood tracker journal for myself after the diagnosis, and it has been more helpful. It makes me really reflect and spend time to find the root of my own feelings and reactions. Essentially, I want to make an app that I can use as well.
This app allows you to create an account, sign in, and log your daiy mood and reflection. You can view all of your posts, update, and delete your posts as well. It's good to track yourself over time for your own mental sake. 

There is also a timer option to help with productivity and also serves as a reminder to take breaks. The timer is set for 25 minutes each time. After each round, it will remind you to take a short break. After 4 rounds, it will remind you to take a longer break. I think this is so useful because it provides that external pressure to be productive, but it also gives you the breaks that you need.

Due to time, I am unable to execute a more complex app, but this is something I would want to build on over time.

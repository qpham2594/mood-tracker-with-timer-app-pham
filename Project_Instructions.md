# Project Instructions

(**NOTE:** View a rendered version of this file in VS Code with `ctrl-shift-v` or `cmd-shift-v`)

&nbsp;
## Introduction

For this project, you will create a server-rendered application using NodeJS, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL or MongoDB. 

&nbsp;
## Theme and Topic

There is no prompt for this assignment like "recreate a business website", "create a food and wine pairing application", etc. The theme and idea of the project will be determined by you.

Be creative when selecting a topic or theme for your project. The topic should be something that allows you to utilize the skills taught in this class to create something you find useful in some capacity. A useful application/project is one you picture yourself using in the future.

The purpose of this project is both to assess your skills **and provide a piece for your professional portfolio**. The theme may still reflect your personal interests and be a niche only you are interested in, however, it should still be something you are comfortable sharing with future employers.

&nbsp;
## Requirements

To receive full credit for this assignment, the finished application MUST:

- Be useful (see [Theme and Topic](#theme-and-topic))
- Be a Node and Express application.
- Use Handlebars templates to render HTML.
- Use MySQL or MongoDB as a database solution
- Follow the MVC pattern.
- Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete data operations for a data resource. User data (username, password, etc.) **DOES NOT** count towards this requirement.
- Incorporate at least one external API in a meaningful way.
- Be responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- Be deployed to Heroku and connected to JawsDB or MongoDB Atlas.
- Regardless of database solution, the application must relate two different types of stored data in some fashion. Associating a data resource with user data **WILL** satisfy this requirement if you make an app with authentication regardless of whether you use a starter template.
- A high-quality README file describing the purpose and usage of the application. Gifs and/or Screenshots in the README are encouraged.

You **may**:

- Use any CSS framework.
- Use more than one external API.
- Include automated tests if you wish.
- Use the provided starter project templates to bootstrap your project.

You **may NOT**:

- Re-use **ANY** code from previous courses, assignments, or projects.
- Use any SPA framework such as React, Vue, Angular, etc.
- Use JQuery.
- Create a blog, e-commerce site, or TODO application.

**NOTE:** Authentication is **NOT** required for this project. However, many application ideas often necessitate users logging in to create personalized content. If your idea requires logging in but you are not comfortable implementing auth on your own, the included starter projects have authentication implemented with both MySQL and MongoDB versions. You may use one of these as starter code or as a reference when building your project.

&nbsp;
## Setup and Starter Code

Create a public Repository in GitHub.

Include a project description that describes your project.

Please select to generate a README file and license for your project. The MIT license would likely suffice, but you are free to choose a different license if you wish.

Included in this folder are two starter projects that have authentication implemented with either MySQL or MongoDB. These projects include all the necessary dependencies and scripts to work with either database, and include the handlebars template engine and an MVC folder structure.

## Submission

For this project, please submit:

- The link to the project's GitHub repository.
- The link to the deployed application on Heroku.
